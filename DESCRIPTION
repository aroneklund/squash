Author: Aron C. Eklund
Maintainer: Aron C. Eklund <aroneklund@gmail.com>
Imports: graphics, grDevices, methods, stats
Description: Functions for color-based visualization of multivariate data, i.e. colorgrams or heatmaps.  Lower-level functions  map numeric values to colors, display a matrix as an array of colors, and draw color keys.  Higher-level plotting functions generate a bivariate histogram, a dendrogram aligned with a color-coded matrix, a triangular distance matrix, and more.
