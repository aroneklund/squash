Squash NEWS

Changes in version 1.0.8 (2017-05-29)

- Modernized package dependencies: "Depends" are now "Imports"


Changes in version 1.0.7 (2015-08-01)

- Minor adjustments to DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE to address CRAN check complaints
- Removed links in Rd files to non-essential packages


Changes in version 1.0.6 (2014-08-04)

- Minor documentation adjustments to address CRAN check complaints


Changes in version 1.0.5 (2012-10-11)

- Fixed a bug in "prettyInt" that caused it to return a single value for cases such as "prettyInt(1, n = 10)"
- Fixed a bug in "prettyLog" that caused an error for "prettyLog(0)"
- Fixed a bug in "makecmap" which was introduced in version 1.02 and caused the color map to fail to cover the range of values of x, in certain cases.


Changes in version 1.0.4 (2012-09-05)

- "colorgram" now has an argument "symm".


Changes in version 1.0.3 (2012-05-23)

- In "colorgram", the argument "key.args" produces an error if it includes "title" or "map", because the "title" and "map" should be specified elsewhere. The error is now slightly more informative.


Changes in version 1.0.2 (2012-01-18)

- Minor documentation fixes
- Simplification and bugfixes in "makecmap"
- Added a (default) NAMESPACE file


Changes in version 1.0.1 (2011-08-15)

- First CRAN release
- "hist2" now has a new argument "breaks", which defaults to "prettyInt"
- Fixed bug in "cimage" in which axes were plotted when add=TRUE
- Fixed bug in "makecmap" causing domain extension into positive numbers when x is all negative
- Fixed bug in which "prettyLog" could return only a single value
- Add check for zero-length x in "prettyInt" and "prettyLog" to match behavior of "pretty"
- "prettyInt" now performs better when x includes all of {zero, negative numbers, positive numbers}
- In "makecmap", the old argument "center" is now called "symm" (for symmetric)
- "makecmap" gets a ... argument, passed to "breaks"
- "dendromat" now ends with par(usr) set to c(0,1,0,1)) instead of something unpredictable; this should make legend placement a bit easier.
- "dendromat" now ends by resetting the clipping region, so "vkey" can be used afterwards.


Changes in version 1.0.0 (2011-08-11)

- MAJOR update, with several function names *changed* to improve clarity; sorry for any inconvenience 
- The previous "colormap" is now called "makecmap"
- The previous "num2col" is now called "cmap"
- The previous "raster" is now called "cimage"
- The option "trueRaster" is now called "useRaster" for consistency with the standard function "image".
- Remove the old "orangeblue"
- The old "orangeblue2" is now "blueorange"
- The old "darkredblue" is slightly adjusted to make the extremes distinguishable and is now called "darkbluered"
- New color palette "bluered".
- The old function "squash" is now called "matapply"
- The old function "mat2bm" is now called "savemat"
- Improvements in automatic axis naming in squashgram and matapply

- Added function "xyz.coords.matrix".
- "squash" now accepts a matrix as input, using xyz.coords.matrix
- The former "minikey2h" and "minikey2v" have been replaced by "hkey" and "vkey", which are similar but have slightly different arguments

- "colorgram" and "distogram" updated to call hkey and vkey
- Replaced function "triplotCol" with "trianglegram", which now accepts new arguments.
- "raster" and "colorgram" no longer accept labels (character) for x and y

- Added function "matpng".


Changes in version 0.3.0 (2009-07-21)

- "pretty.int" was broken in several ways, but should be fixed now.
- Removed "pretty.count".
- Added function "pretty.auto".
- "colorgram" now works differently: 1. The parameter "key" now takes numeric values to specify the type of key. 2. Removed parameter "key.width".  3. Added parameter "key.args".


Changes in version 0.2.3 (2009-07-18)

- New functions "minikey2h" and "minikey2v".

- Revert many of the changes to "colormap" made in v. 0.2.0.
- Modified the "pretty.*" functions.
- Removed "int" argument from "colorgram".
- Many other fixes and updates.
- Remove "legend.map".


Changes in version 0.2.1 (2009-05-05)

- In "colormap", new parameters: "int", "col.zero".
- "Colormap" now can do "integer-based" maps.
- In "colormap", defaults for "right" is now TRUE, which matches the defaults for "cut".  (Originally, it was the other way around because this made more sense for integers).
- Added helper functions "pretty.int", "integer.intervals".
- Documentation fixes.
- Added arguments to "dendromat":  "border", "cex.lab" (suggested by Chris Workman).
- Added "gap" argument to "dendromat".

- Misc. documentation fixes.


Changes in version 0.1.5 (2008-03-02)

- Update "raster" to work work with non-evenly spaced breakpoints/midpoints and non-1 zsize.
- These changes also fix buggy behavior in raster.
- Misc. documentation fixes.

- In "drawKey", changed default las.axis = 1


Changes in version 0.1.3 (2008-02-26)

- Documentation improvements.
- "squash" now uses "xyz.coords" for input, and returns additional list items "xlab", "ylab", and "zlab".
- Similarly, "hist2" now used "xy.coords".
- The argument in "colorgram" formerly called "key.lab" is now called "zlab", for compatibility with "persp".  Also, "xlab" and "ylab" are specifically included in the argument list.
- "colorgram" and "raster" now try harder to assign dimension labels.
- "raster" is a bit more flexible with input (but still not ideal).

-  Default "las.lab" argument is now 0.
-  Default "las.axis" argument is now 2.
-  "side" = 1 and "side" = 3 now work.
-  By default (i.e., when "by" = NA), the function tries to avoid plotting axis labels on top of each other.
