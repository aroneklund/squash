Depends: grDevices
Description: This package provides functions for color-based visualization of multivariate data, i.e. colorgrams or heatmaps.  Lower-level functions are provided to map numeric values to colors, display a matrix as an array of colors, and draw color keys.  Higher-level plotting functions are provided to generate a bivariate histogram, a dendrogram aligned with a color-coded matrix, a triangular distance matrix, and more.
